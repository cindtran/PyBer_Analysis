# PyBer_Analysis

# Purpose

The purpose of this analysis is to review total weekly fares for each city type while using Matplotlib to display visuals.

# Results

Viewing the dataframe below, we see the total number of rides, drivers and average fare per driver and ride for each geo area. After viewing the results, the rural area has the highest fare for both driver and ride and that could be due to having less drivers compared to the other geo areas.

Total Fare by City Type

The line graph below displays the total fares over a time frame of five months. For the urban area, there was peek in demand starting the end of February until April. The trend seems to be similar for those months in the other geo areas except for suburban which only had a high request for the end of February.

# Summary/Insights:

- Urban area the most peeks throughout that time frame
- The highest average fare for rides are in line with the highest average fare for drivers
- Suburban area fares are consistent throughout the months except late Februrary where there was peek and then there was a dip in April
- After analyzing the data, the end of February had the highest peek in demand in all three geo areas. Would take in some consideration of researching the cause in demand during this time.
